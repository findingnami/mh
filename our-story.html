                <p>Neither of them knew that their adventures would soon be interrupted by the pandemic lockdown, leaving them stranded far from home as Locally Stranded Individuals (LSIs).</p>
                <br>
                <p>As Metro Manila announced its lockdown, a mutual acquaintance created a group chat, informing them that they were on the same scheduled trip back to Manila from the Visayas region. When they finally returned, Melvin settled in Mandaluyong, while Hope resumed life in Quezon City.</p>
                <br>
                <p>What started as a simple acquaintance gradually blossomed into a meaningful friendship. They began meeting at UP Diliman campus, biking and jogging together, their connection growing stronger with every shared moment. Bonded by a love for adventure, they embarked on hiking expeditions, camping trips, beach getaways, and countless food adventures.</p>
                <br>
                <p>What began as an unexpected encounter turned into a beautiful journeyâ€”one filled with laughter, discovery, and unforgettable experiences. Through every adventure, their bond deepened, proving that sometimes, love finds its way in the most unexpected places.</p>

                <p>In May 2024, Hope secretly booked a flight to Siargao, planning a surprise trip to celebrate her and Melvinâ€™s birthdays together. Their trip had begun in November 2024, and at the time, she had no idea that Melvin had his own plans in motion. She chose Siargao not only because she longed to return to the island but also to complete her travels across the Agusan provinces.</p>
                <br>
                <p>On their final day in Siargao, they visited Maasin River, arriving as the first visitors of the day. As Hope wandered through the scenic surroundings, Melvin quietly followed, capturing photos and recording videos. When she turned around, she was met with an unforgettable sightâ€”Melvin, down on one knee, holding out a ring.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Overwhelmed with emotion, Hope froze in disbelief, questioning if the moment was real. Shocked, she instinctively stepped away, tears streaming down her face. When she finally returned to him, the only words she could manage were to ask if he was truly certain about proposing.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Despite her initial reaction, she ultimately said yes, deeply moved by the thought and effort Melvin had poured into making this moment so special. It was an unexpected yet beautiful surpriseâ€”one that she would cherish forever.</p>
